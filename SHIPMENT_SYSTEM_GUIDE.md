### API Testing with curl

**Create Shipment:**
```powershell
curl -X POST http://localhost:3002/shipments `
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" `
  -d '{
    "trackingNumber": "1Z999AA10123456784",
    "carrier": "Auto",
    "poNumber": "PO10001",
    "priority": "Normal"
  }'
```

**Get Statistics:**

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"PO not found" when creating shipment**
- Ensure PO number exactly matches existing PO
- Check PO exists in database
- Verify spelling and capitalization

**Carrier not auto-detected**
- Check tracking number format
- Verify it matches known patterns
- Manually select carrier if needed

**Shipments not appearing**
- Check MongoDB connection
- Verify authentication working
- Clear filters and refresh

**Statistics showing 0**
- Create some test shipments first
- Refresh the page
- Check browser console for errors

### Debug Mode
Enable additional logging in `routes/shipments.js`:
```javascript
console.log('Query:', query);
console.log('Shipments found:', shipments.length);
```
