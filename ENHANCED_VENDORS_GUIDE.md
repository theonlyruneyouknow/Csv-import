## 🔄 How They Work Together

### Data Architecture

```
Main Vendor Model (ALL vendors)
        ↑
        |
        ├─────→ Classic Vendors Dashboard
        |
        └─────→ Enhanced Vendors Dashboard
                     ↓
                     |
                (cross-references)
                     ↓
        OrganicVendor Model (subset)
                     ↑
                     |
                     └─────→ Organic Vendors Dashboard
```

### Key Relationships:

1. **Vendor Model** = Primary database for ALL vendors
   - Contains: vendorCode, vendorName, status, email, etc.
   - Used by: Classic Vendors + Enhanced Vendors

2. **OrganicVendor Model** = Subset for organic certifications
   - Contains: certificationDates, agency, USDA links
   - Links to Vendor via: `internalId` → `vendorCode`
   - Used by: Organic Vendors + Enhanced Vendors

3. **Enhanced Vendors Dashboard** = Bridge between both
   - Queries Vendor model for all vendors
   - Cross-references OrganicVendor model for cert data
   - Shows combined view with organic status inline
