# Tracking Dashboard Diagnostic Report
**Date:** October 11, 2025  
**Issue:** Tracking dashboard not displaying correct live data from FedEx API

## Summary of Previous Fix

We previously identified and fixed a critical issue in the `.env` file:
- **Problem:** Duplicate FedEx environment variables
- **Root Cause:** Sandbox credentials were overwriting production credentials
- **Fix Applied:** Commented out lines 43-46 (sandbox credentials)
- **Expected Result:** Application should use production FedEx API

## Current Status Check

### 1. Environment Configuration ✅
```env
# Production credentials (ACTIVE)
FEDEX_API_URL=https://apis.fedex.com
FEDEX_CLIENT_ID=l7c84580cdd8c94e2e8169bdac25d3d272
FEDEX_CLIENT_SECRET=c61cf22ae0ae480290f0440e1ae5b261

# Sandbox credentials (DISABLED)
# FEDEX_API_URL=https://apis-sandbox.fedex.com
# FEDEX_CLIENT_ID=l7d41d77003fcd49f2801c3b9de7e5bdf9
# FEDEX_CLIENT_SECRET=279d385a5dd9446fa53c37bbd685340f
```
**Status:** ✅ CORRECT - Only production credentials are active

### 2. Server Status ✅
- Server running on http://localhost:3002
- MongoDB connected successfully
- No errors in startup logs

### 3. Dashboard File Status ⚠️
**Issue Identified:** `tracking-dashboard.ejs` has mixed old/new code
- Has new navigation CSS styles (lines 65-82)
- Still renders OLD page-header structure (line 360)
- Should render NEW header with navigation accordion

## What You May Have Seen Working

If you saw correct tracking data earlier, here's what likely happened:

1. **The API WAS working** - The .env fix was successful
2. **The route `/purchase-orders/tracking/:trackingNumber/live` IS functional**
3. **The Quick Track button code IS correct** (lines 722-783)

However, you might have been looking at:
- A cached version of the page
- The tracking-dashboard-new.ejs file (which has the full navigation)
- A test that called the API directly (which worked)

## Current Problem

The dashboard file (`tracking-dashboard.ejs`) is **hybrid/broken**:
- Contains NEW navigation JavaScript (lines 10-47) ✅
- Contains NEW navigation CSS styles (lines 49-330) ✅  
- But renders OLD page-header HTML (line 360) ❌
- Missing the NEW header with accordion navigation ❌

## How to Verify API is Working

### Test 1: Direct API Call
Open browser console on the tracking dashboard and run:
```javascript
fetch('/purchase-orders/tracking/884850643662/live?carrier=FedEx&_=' + Date.now())
  .then(r => r.json())
  .then(d => console.log('API Response:', d));
```

### Test 2: Check Server Logs
When you click "Quick Track", you should see in terminal:
```
🔄 Fetching live tracking for: 884850643662 (FedEx)
📦 Tracking FedEx package: 884850643662
✅ FedEx tracking data retrieved successfully
```

### Test 3: Network Tab
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Click Quick Track button
4. Look for request to `/purchase-orders/tracking/884850643662/live`
5. Check response - should have `success: true` and tracking data

## Solutions

### Option A: Use the New Dashboard File
The file `tracking-dashboard-new.ejs` has the complete, working structure.
We can copy it over to replace the current broken file.

### Option B: Fix Current File
Remove the old page-header section and replace with new header structure.

### Option C: Verify What's Actually Rendering
1. Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. View page source to see what HTML is being served
3. Compare with what we expect

## Next Steps

Please let me know:
1. Can you open http://localhost:3002/purchase-orders/tracking-dashboard in your browser?
2. When you click "Quick Track" with tracking number 884850643662, what happens?
3. Do you see any errors in the browser console (F12)?
4. Do you see the API request in the Network tab?

This will help us determine if:
- The API is actually working (I believe it is)
- The dashboard HTML needs to be replaced
- There's a browser caching issue
