# Missing URLs Filter Feature - October 28, 2025

## 🎯 Feature Overview

Added a new filter checkbox to show **only Purchase Orders without URLs**, making it easy to identify and add missing URLs after CSV imports.

---

## ✨ What's New

### **"Missing URLs Only" Filter**

A new checkbox filter in the Purchase Orders Dashboard that filters the list to show only POs that don't have a URL attached.

**Location:** Filters section, next to "Show Pending Bill" checkbox

**Label:** "Missing URLs Only"  
**Checkbox Text:** "Show POs without URLs"

---

## 🎮 How to Use

### **After a CSV Import:**

1. Go to **Purchase Orders Dashboard**
2. Find the **"Missing URLs Only"** filter (in the filters section)
3. ✅ **Check the box** "Show POs without URLs"
4. The list will instantly filter to show **only POs missing URLs**
5. Add URLs to each PO using the 🔗 icon
6. Uncheck the box to return to normal view

### **Workflow Example:**

```
1. Import CSV file with new POs
   ↓
2. Check "Missing URLs Only" box
   ↓
3. See filtered list of POs without URLs
   ↓
4. Click 🔗 icon on each PO
   ↓
5. Add URL and save
   ↓
6. PO disappears from filtered list
   ↓
7. Repeat until list is empty
   ↓
8. Uncheck box - all POs now have URLs!
```

## 🔍 Technical Details

### **Filter Logic:**

- When **UNCHECKED** (default): Shows all POs (normal behavior)
- When **CHECKED**: Shows only POs where `poUrl` field is empty or null

### **Combines with Other Filters:**

The missing URLs filter works together with all existing filters:
- Search (vendor, PO#, tracking#)
- Priority filter
- NS Status filter
- Status filter
- Notes filter
- Show "Not my concern"
- Show "Pending Bill"

**Example:** You can search for "Johnny" AND check "Missing URLs Only" to see only Johnny Seeds POs without URLs.

---

## 📊 Visual Feedback

### **Console Logging:**

When filtering is applied, the console shows:
```
🔍 Filter results: X visible, Y "Not my concern" hidden, Z "Pending Bill" hidden, W with URLs hidden
```

The `W with URLs hidden` count shows how many POs were filtered out because they already have URLs.

### **Results Counter:**

The "Showing X of Y" counter updates to reflect how many POs are visible after filtering.

---

## 💡 Use Cases

### **1. Post-Import URL Management**
After importing a CSV with new POs, quickly identify which ones need URLs added.

### **2. Periodic Cleanup**
Regularly check for POs missing URLs and fill them in.

### **3. Quality Control**
Ensure all POs have proper documentation links before processing.

### **4. Vendor-Specific URL Addition**
Combine with search to add URLs for specific vendor's POs:
- Search: "Johnny"
- Check: "Missing URLs Only"
- Result: Only Johnny Seeds POs without URLs

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### **Files Modified:**

1. **views/dashboard.ejs**
   - Added checkbox HTML in filters section (line ~3604)
   - Added filter logic in `applyFilters()` function
   - Added event listener for checkbox change
   - Updated `clearAllFilters()` to reset checkbox
   - Added logging for filtered count

### **Code Changes:**

**Filter Checkbox:**
```html
<div class="filter-group">
    <label style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Missing URLs Only</label>
    <label style="display: flex; align-items: center; gap: 5px; margin-top: 19px;">
        <input type="checkbox" id="showOnlyMissingUrls" style="margin: 0;">
        <span style="font-size: 12px;">Show POs without URLs</span>
    </label>
</div>
```

**Filter Logic:**
```javascript
const showOnlyMissingUrlsCheckbox = document.getElementById('showOnlyMissingUrls');
const showOnlyMissingUrls = showOnlyMissingUrlsCheckbox ? showOnlyMissingUrlsCheckbox.checked : false;

const poUrl = poData.poUrl || '';
const hasUrl = poUrl && poUrl.trim().length > 0;
const shouldShowBasedOnUrl = !showOnlyMissingUrls || !hasUrl;

// In visibility check:
if (... && shouldShowBasedOnUrl) {
    // Show row
}
```

**Event Listener:**
```javascript
document.getElementById('showOnlyMissingUrls').addEventListener('change', applyFilters);
```
